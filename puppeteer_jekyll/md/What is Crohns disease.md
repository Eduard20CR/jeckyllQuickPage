## Understanding inflammation

Not all inflammation is bad, and your immune system actually raises inflammation levels to protect you. But when your immune system is overactive, high inflammation levels become damaging, and this process plays a critical role in your CD symptoms.<sup>4</sup>

Your new medication belongs to a group of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and contains the active substance upadacitinib. It treats your CD by lowering inflammation and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup>5</sup>
