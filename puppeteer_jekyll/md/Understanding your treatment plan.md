Your treatment plan will be broken into two phases. Let’s take a closer look!

## Initiation phase<sup>1</sup>

The first phase of your treatment plan will be known as the initiation phase. During your first 12 weeks of treatment, you will take a higher daily dose of ▼RINVOQ<sup>®</sup> (upadacitinib) to treat your Crohn’s disease (CD).

- Your initiation dose during this phase will be one 45-mg tablet taken daily
- The 45-mg tablets are yellow to mottled yellow with an “a45” imprinted on them

## Maintenance phase<sup>1</sup>

The second phase of your treatment plan is known as the maintenance phase. After the first 12 weeks of your treatment you will switch to a lower daily dose of RINVOQ to manage your CD over time.

- Your maintenance dose during this phase will be either one 15-mg tablet or one 30-mg tablet taken daily\* [Affiliates to localise as needed]
- The 15-mg tablets are purple with an ‘a15’ imprinted on them, while the 30-mg tablets are red with an ‘a30’ imprinted on them
- Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on how you respond to the medicine

As CD is a chronic condition, you should continue to take your maintenance dose even if you are feeling well until told otherwise by your doctor or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) nurse.

Footnote \*If you are 65 years or older, recommended dose is 15 mg once a day for your long-term treatment. Your doctor may reduce your dose if you have kidney problems, or you are prescribed certain other medicines.<sup>1</sup>
